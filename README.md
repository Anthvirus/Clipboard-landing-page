A project I worked on during my internship program at Mkobo microfinance bank. I got the task from Front-end mentors.

This project helped me to:
-Improve my knowledge of flexbox
-Improve my Sizings and measurements.
-Semantic html
-CSS use.
-Images.
-CSS Media query
-Use different flex attributes to achieve better results.

I got the project from front-end mentors.

Problems i encountered are manipulating icons, importing fonts.
